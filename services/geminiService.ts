        Analyze the provided policy RENEWAL document PDF.
        First, determine if the policy is for 'Home' or 'Auto'. Set the 'renewalType' field accordingly.
        Then, extract the following key pieces of information. If a value is not found, use an empty string "".

        **Always Extract These:**
        - carrierName: The name of the insurance carrier company. Look for the company name in the letterhead, header, or near a logo. Common carriers include Nationwide, Progressive, National General, Foremost, etc.
        - policyHolder: Policy Holder's full name.
        - recipientName: Policy Holder's first name.
        - policyNumber: The full policy number. It's critical. Look for labels like "Policy Number", "Policy #", or "Policy:". It is often at the top of the document and can be alphanumeric.
        - quoteAmount: The new total premium or total renewal cost (e.g., "$1,310.00").
        - previousQuoteAmount: **CRITICAL**: Find the expiring term's premium for comparison. Look for labels like "Current Premium", "Prior Term Premium", "Expiring Premium", or a summary table comparing old and new costs. Format as a currency string like "$1,250.00".
        - renewalDue: The policy effective date for the new term. Look for labels like "Effective Date", "Renewal Date", "Policy Period", "Term Begins", or a date range (e.g., "12/01/2024 to 12/01/2025"). Use the starting date of the new term. Parse various date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, Month Day, YYYY) and convert to YYYY-MM-DD.
        - renewalType: The type of policy, must be one of "Home", "Auto", or "Other".
        - monthlyPremium: Calculated monthly cost. For Home, this is quoteAmount / 12. For Auto, divide by the policy term. Format as a currency string like "$109.17".
        - policyTerm: For Home, this is always '12'. For Auto, determine if the term is 6 or 12 months from the policy dates (e.g., "12/01/2024 to 06/01/2025" is 6 months) and return '6' or '12'.

        **If it is a HOME policy, also extract:**
        - propertyAddress: The full property address being insured.
        - dwellingCoverage: Dwelling coverage amount (e.g., "$360,000").
        - otherStructuresCoverage: Other Structures coverage amount.
        - personalPropertyCoverage: Personal Property coverage amount.
        - lossOfUseCoverage: Loss of Use coverage amount.
        - personalLiabilityCoverage: Personal Liability coverage amount.
        - medicalPaymentsCoverage: Medical Payments coverage amount.
        - deductible: The primary deductible amount (e.g., "$1,000 All Perils").

        **If it is an AUTO policy, also extract:**
        - autoVehicles: A list of the vehicles covered, as a single string (e.g., "2023 Toyota Camry, 2021 Ford F-150").

        - carrierName: The brand name of the insurance carrier company. This is the main, well-known name, often found at the top of the document (e.g., 'National General', 'Nationwide', 'Progressive'). If you see multiple company names, prioritize this brand name over a more obscure underwriting company name (e.g., prefer 'National General' over 'Integon Preferred Insurance Company').
        - policyHolder: The full name of the policyholder.
        - recipientName: The first name of the policyholder.
        - policyNumber: The full policy number.
        - receiptAmount: The amount paid. Format as a currency string like "$123.45".
        - receiptDatePaid: The date the payment was made. Parse various formats and convert to YYYY-MM-DD.
        - receiptConfirmationNumber: The confirmation or transaction number.
        - receiptPaymentMethod: The method of payment (e.g., "Visa **** 1234", "Bank Account").
        - receiptProduct: The type of insurance paid for. Should be one of "Auto", "Home", "Commercial", "Other".

      - Document Type: ${formData.documentType}

      - Home Dwelling Coverage: ${formData.dwellingCoverage || 'N/A'}

      - Other Details: ${formData.endorsements || formData.autoExtraCoverages || 'None specified.'}
  
      **Your Task:**
      Return a JSON array of objects, where each object represents one opportunity. Each object must have three keys:
      1.  "title": A short, catchy title for the opportunity (e.g., "Umbrella Policy Needed").
      2.  "suggestionText": A brief, one-sentence explanation of WHY you are suggesting this, for the agent to see (e.g., "Client has high-value home but standard liability.").
      3.  "promptToInject": The professional, client-facing text to be added to the email. Frame it as helpful advice. (e.g., "Given the value of your property, I also highly recommend we discuss an Umbrella Liability policy. It's an affordable way to add an extra layer of protection over and above your standard home and auto limits.").
  
      **Examples of Opportunities to look for:**
      - If Dwelling coverage is high (e.g., > $500k) or Personal liability is high, suggest an Umbrella policy.
      - If Auto Bodily Injury limits are low (e.g., state minimum like '25k/50k'), recommend increasing them and explain the benefit.
      - If the client is getting a Home quote but has vehicles listed, suggest bundling for a discount.
      - If the client is renewing an Auto policy, suggest a quote for Home/Renters insurance to get a multi-policy discount.
      
      Analyze the data and provide relevant, high-value suggestions. If no clear opportunities exist, return an empty array.

          - Reassure them that their new rate reflects the current cost to protect their property adequately.
          - End by inviting them to call if they'd like to discuss it further.
